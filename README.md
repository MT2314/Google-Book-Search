# Google Books Search

React-based Google Books Search app. Using Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can search for books from the New York Time best seller list, create their own lists, can disaply favourites and mark books read.

### SCHEMA

```js
{
  authors: ["Suzanne Collins"];
  description: "Set in a dark vision of the near future, a terrifying reality TV show is taking place. Twelve boys and twelve girls are forced to appear in a live event called The Hunger Games. There is only one rule: kill or be killed. When sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen steps forward to take her younger sister's place in the games, she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature.";

  link: "http://books.google.com/books?id=sazytgAACAAJ&dq=title:The+Hunger+Games&hl=&source=gbs_api";
  title: "The Hunger Games";
}
```

Express routes:

- `/api/books` (get) - Should return all saved books as JSON.

- `/api/books` (post) - Will be used to save a new book to the database.

- `/api/books/:id` (delete) - Will be used to delete a book from the database by Mongo `_id`.

---

### Bonus Live Updates to Saved Books

- Use React routing and [socket.io](http://socket.io) to create a notification or a component that triggers whenever a user saves an book. Your message should include the title of the saved book.

  - Say you have multiple browsers open, each one visiting your site. If you save an book in one browser, then all of your browsers should notify you that a new book was saved.

  - [Socket.io NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io)
